Introduction
As a developer always seeking to improve my skills and infrastructure knowledge,
I recently embarked on a journey to build a production-ready Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
This project was an incredible learning experience, filled with challenges and triumphs. 
In this blog post, I'll share my journey, the obstacles I encountered, and the solutions that helped me create a resilient and secure VPC
Starting with the Basics: Setting Up the VPC
My journey began with creating the VPC, the foundational building block of my network infrastructure.

One of the first challenges was selecting the appropriate IPv4 CIDR block.
I wanted to ensure enough IP addresses for future scaling while avoiding overlaps with other networks I might integrate with later. 
I opted for a 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block, which provides a large number of IP addresses and leaves room for subnetting. 
The servers in private subnets needed internet access for updates and external communication, but direct access wasn't an option due to security concerns.
I deployed NAT Gateways in both public subnets. This setup allowed instances in private subnets to connect to the internet securely.
One of the more complex parts was setting up an Auto Scaling group to manage the number of instances based on demand.
I created a launch configuration with the desired Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type.
Then, I set up an Auto Scaling group that spanned the private subnets, ensuring instances would scale based on predefined policies.

Conclusion
Building this production-ready VPC was a challenging yet rewarding journey. Each obstacle taught me valuable lessons about cloud infrastructure and networking. By ensuring high availability, security, and scalability, I've created a robust environment ready to handle production workloads.

I hope my journey inspires you to tackle your projects
